The previous Build.PL did (nearly) everything. Now you need to:

  perlbrew install perl-5.26.1 # creates your own personal, isolated perl
  perlbrew use perl-5.26.1 # switch to new
  perlbrew lib create normal # creates a local perl-modules installation place
  perlbrew use perl-5.26.1@normal # uses that

Now do the stuff for Slic3r:

  perl Makefile.PL # maybe add --gui, per the wiki
  cpanm --installdeps . # gets the things you need to proceed
  make test
